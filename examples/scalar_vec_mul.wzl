# Simple vector test

# Create a vector
vec = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print(vec);  # Should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# For result variable, manually initialize as vector first
result = vec;
print(result);  # Should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Now test scalar-vector multiplication 
scale = 2;
mult_result = vec;  # Initialize as vector
i = 0;
# Manually implement multiplication
while (i < 5) {
    mult_result[i] = vec[i] * scale;
    i = i + 1;
}
print(mult_result);  # Should print [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
